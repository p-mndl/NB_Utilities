This repo is based on the work of Miles Cole, who wrote a fantastic guide on how to develop custom python packages within Microsoft Fabric notebooks.

His articles can be found [here](https://milescole.dev/data-engineering/2024/07/18/Developing-Python-Libraries-Using-Microsoft-Fabric.html).

This notebook is a slight adaption of the code in the article
- added a function to create the basic folder/file structure
- switched from executing a setup.py to build installer
- added some parametrization here and there
